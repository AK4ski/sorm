Simple Object Relational Mapper (SORM) is a simplified ORM tool.

It will provide basic CRUD operations against relational databases (H2, Postgres & MySql ) out of the box. 
The boilerplate SQL code will be reduced and replaced by annotation based approach, used on top of POJO classes and their fields.  

Why am I creating this when there are so many popular open-source, production-ready and well established tools?  
Well, mainly for educational purposes :)

Work in progress...
